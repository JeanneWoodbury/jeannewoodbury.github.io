      The Trans Voter Protection Hotline is a project of <a href="https://www.equalityarizona.org">Equality Arizona</a> in partnership with the <a href="https://www.equalityfederation.org">Equality Federation</a>. Strict voter ID laws mean trans voters can face discrimination at the polls. If you are kept from voting, call or text the trans voter protection hotline at (239) 946-2718, or message us here, between 6 AM and Midnight EST this Election Day.
